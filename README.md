# Tanzanian Faulty Pumps Prediction
## Overview
Access to clean and potable water is crucial for the health and well-being of Tanzanian citizens. However, many water pumps across the country are faulty, leading to 
water shortages and posing significant health risks to communities. To address this issue, we aim to develop a predictive model that can identify faulty water pumps 
based on various features such as pump age, location, type, and condition. By accurately predicting faulty water pumps, authorities and organizations can prioritize 
maintenance and repair efforts, ensuring clean and safe water is readily available to all Tanzanians.

## Business Understanding
The Ministry of Water in Tanzania is a key stakeholder in addressing the issue of faulty water pumps. As the government body responsible for water resource management 
and infrastructure development, the Ministry plays a crucial role in ensuring water supply systems are well-maintained and functional. By leveraging predictive modeling, 
the Ministry can efficiently allocate resources for maintenance and repair activities, improving the reliability and accessibility of clean water for Tanzanian communities.

## Data Understanding
The dataset contains various features related to water pumps, including pump age, location, installer, and funding source. Our objective is to develop a predictive model 
to classify water pumps into functional, non-functional, and functional needs repair categories. Additionally, we aim to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify factors
influencing water pump functionality and maintenance needs. By analyzing historical data on water pump failures and repairs, we can optimize maintenance schedules and resource 
allocation, prioritize interventions in regions with high repair needs, and evaluate the impact of funding sources on water pump functionality.
